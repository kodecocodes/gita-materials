Chapter 7 - Challenge Solution

1. Create a temporary branch with the name of **newBranch**.


git branch newBranch



2. Switch to that branch.

git checkout newBranch



3. Use the `touch` command to create an empty **README.md** file in the root directory of your project.


touch README.md


4. Add that new **README.md** file to the staging area.


git add README.md


5. Commit that change with an appropriate message.


git commit -m "Adding README.md"


6. Checkout the **main** branch.


git checkout main


7. Delete **newBranch** — but Git won’t let you delete this branch in its current state. Why?

First, try the following:


git branch -d newBranch


Git responds with:


error: The branch 'newBranch' is not fully merged.
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D newBranch'.


8. Follow the suggestion that Git gives you to see if you can delete this branch.


git branch -D newBranch
