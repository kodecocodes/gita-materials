Chapter 3 - Challenge Solution

This challenge simply reuses the commands you’ve used in this chapter to accomplish the following tasks:

1. Create a new file named **tutorials_ideas.md** inside the **tutorials** directory.
2. Add a heading to the file: `# Tutorial Ideas`
3. Populate the file with a few ideas, following the format of the other files, for example, `[ ] Mastering PalmOS`.
4. Save your changes.
5. Add those changes to the staging area.
6. Commit those staged changes with an appropriate message

Here are the steps I followed to complete this challenge. You may have used slightly different methods to accomplish the same result, but here’s how I did it:

- Create the new file with the command: touch tutorials/tutorial_ideas.md

- Edit the files using nano, with the command: nano tutorials/tutorial_ideas.md

- Added the following content to the file:

# Tutorial Ideas

Some tutorial ideas to help us branch out into new areas where no tutorial has gone before:

[ ] Mastering PalmOS
[ ] COBOL: Not just for Y2K anymore
[ ] AppleTalk by Tutorials: Your road to the information superhighway

- Saved my changes (in nano, Ctrl + O, Enter, Ctrl + X)

- Staged my changes with "git add ."

- Committed my changes with the command: git commit -m "Adding some tutorial ideas"

- Bonus: To prove to myself that my changes made it there, checked log with the command: git log -p

Which gave me the following output, which I’ve truncated to the important bits:
